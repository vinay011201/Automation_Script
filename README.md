Excited to sharing the Mini-Project of Swag Labs Application by Automation Testing .
Basically Swag Labs is a E-commerce website often used for software testing and automation practice. It is associated with Sauce Labs, a cloud-based testing platform.
In this I write the Test script using Automation Tools like Selenium and various framework of selenium like TestNG etc.
This project focuses on automating the login functionalities, adding and removing item to the cart , checkout process and last logout the application.
